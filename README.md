Hello.

I‚Äôm a very useful music bot that can make you play a music with a simple command! I have a lot of good commands that you can have a better experience playing your favorites songs! Problems with the prefix? You can also change the bot prefix running a simple command! It contains a very complete help that you can run command into the bot dms, you can use *help and have an better description of the command!

You can loop a music of a queue to repeat it! If you want to shuffle the songs, you can do it too!

I‚Äôm here to help you play songs with simple command, with the best quality!

What are you waiting!? Add me now!

Thanks for reading this.
